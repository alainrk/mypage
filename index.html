          <content
            >In the world of software creation, developers have different ways
            of thinking and working. In his enlightening book "A Philosophy of
            Software Design," John Ousterhout talks about the ideas and methods
            that make software design work well (or at least better). One
            important thing he discusses is the difference between tactical and
            strategic developers. This helps us understand the various
            approaches these developers use when creating software, and why the
            modern approaches that companies adopt bring to a dangerous path....

          <asubtitle>Where to place complexity? </asubtitle>
          <content
            >Deeper modules provide a significantly better interface, concealing
            complexity and enhancing clarity and readability. However, this
            improvement does not come without a cost. It demands better design
            and more thoughtful choices. A crucial factor in this process is
            complexity management, and we understand that it is not always
            feasible to eliminate it entirely. Sometimes, it is inherent in the
            domain we operate in, or it arises from real-world scenarios.
            Additionally, in many 'fast-paced' work environments, those who
            contribute (directly or indirectly) to the design of a system are
            often rewarded for short-term choices rather than for long-term
            sustainability...

            >It doesn’t matter if you are an executive pushed by shareholders’
            anxiety, a director facing tough decisions, or a manager tasked with
            reshaping their team. You have to do your part and turn everything
            upside down, even if it means destroying the current culture in
            favor of a greater benefit, such as company profitability, your
            superiors’ profitability, or, if you’re lucky enough, your own
            profitability. In these cases, you can't just wing it. There are a
            few concepts to reconsider in a new light and a dedicated playbook
            to follow step-by-step...
