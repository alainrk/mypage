            indeed a product for consumption, there exists another realm where

          <content
            >I've spent the last few years working with various metrics,
            including DORA, and particularly with MTTR. [...] MTTR's statistical
            significance is remarkably low. When we look at incident data, we
            often see a non-normal distribution of recovery times. Some
            incidents take minutes to resolve, while others might take days,
            independently of their impact and severity. Moreover, most
            companies, especially small and medium-sized businesses, don't
            experience enough incidents to achieve statistical significance in
            their measurements. And if they do have a high volume of incidents,
            that itself should be their primary concern rather than optimizing
            their MTTR...

            >In the world of software creation, developers have different ways
            of thinking and working. In his enlightening book "A Philosophy of
            Software Design," John Ousterhout talks about the ideas and methods
            that make software design work well (or at least better). One
            important thing he discusses is the difference between tactical and
            strategic developers. This helps us understand the various
            approaches these developers use when creating software, and why the
            modern approaches that companies adopt bring to a dangerous path...

          <content
            >Deeper modules provide a significantly better interface, concealing
            complexity and enhancing clarity and readability. However, this
            improvement does not come without a cost. It demands better design
            and more thoughtful choices. A crucial factor in this process is
            complexity management, and we understand that it is not always
            feasible to eliminate it entirely. Sometimes, it is inherent in the
            domain we operate in, or it arises from real-world scenarios.
            Additionally, in many 'fast-paced' work environments, those who
            contribute (directly or indirectly) to the design of a system are
            often rewarded for short-term choices rather than for long-term
            sustainability...

            reshaping their team. You have to do your part and turn everything
            upside down, even if it means destroying the current culture in
            favor of a greater benefit, such as company profitability, your
            superiors’ profitability, or, if you’re lucky enough, your own
            profitability. In these cases, you can't just wing it. There are a
